"""
Module containing User data models for application.

This module defines two classes: UserBase and UserFull, both derived from Pydantic BaseModel.
These classes represent the structure of user data in the application, with UserBase as a base model
containing common attributes like user_name, name, and password_hash, and UserFull extending it by
adding an id attribute.
